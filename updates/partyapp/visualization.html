					<h1>Visualization</h1>
				</div>
				
				<p >
					We needed an effective way to make people who were at the party, but not yet playing the game, aware of what we had concocted and hopefully entice them to participate.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					For those who were already playing the game, we wanted to visualize how they were doing and allow them to share their progress with others. 
					In addition to the information provided through the iOS App UI we needed to display on highly visible screens how many beacons they had claimed and what kind of 
					impressive barscore they had managed to amass. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Most importantly though we wanted some kind of fun way to visualize micro-location detection and share the selfies people took with the iOS App with the rest of the party crowd… 
				</p>
				
				<h3>D3.js</h3>
				
				<p>
					When it came to HTML based visualization the choice was easy. We had successfully utilized D3.js for client projects and felt comfortable enough that we would be able to 
					hack up something interesting for this.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					If you have not heard about D3.js, it is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data using HTML, SVG and CSS. For more information check out  <a href="http://www.d3js.org">D3.js</a>
				</p>
				
				<h3>‘People At The Bar’ Visualization</h3>
				
				<p>
					We figured the best way to visualize micro-location detection was to simulate typical 'people at the bar' behaviour, to display their mugshot and screen name and attempt to engage 
					them with game related personalized messages. The iOS App already detects if a person is close to iBeacons placed strategically at the bar. The Server App provides a web-service 
					giving us all the players who were currently at the bar.  All we needed was an interesting way to simulate people hanging out a bar, bumping into each other, trying to push through 
					the crowd to order a drink. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					A quick doodle clarified things a bit....
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<img src="/svg/peopleAtTheBar.svg">
				</p>

				<p>
					The people in the sketch all look a bit pissed off, hopefully the real crowd would be happier, but we shall see. New arrivals would come bouncing onto the screen causing 
					movement of others already at the bar… just like in the real world.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<a href="https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Force-Layout#force">d3.layout.force</a> provides all of the features that are needed to perfectly simulate the forces at play in a 
					crowded bar. A little bit of JavaScript, CSS and SVG hacking and bubbles of people were bouncing around the screen.  If you are interested in how it was all implemented you can 
					take a look at the src code here:
					<a href="https://github.com/objectlab/Visualization">https://github.com/objectlab/Visualization</a>
				</p>
				
				<h3>‘Leaderboard’ Visualization</h3>
				
				<p>
					The second visualization needed to show the current leaders in both game play objectives. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					First, a leaderboard for the highest barscore. We figured the more people frequented the bar the more drinks they had to be consuming.  Therefore the complicated mathematical 
					equation of:
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<code>high barscore = high level of drunkenness</code>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The second game objective would be to collect all of the iBeacons hidden in the club. The party had somewhat of a TRON related theme, so to visualize each iBeacons we borrowed 
					some of the fantastically nerdy TRON symbols.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Again we wanted to incorporate the players’ pictures and their screen names and add a little animation into the mix.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Another doodle clarified what had to be done...
				</p>
				<p>
					<img src="/svg/leaderboard.svg">
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The barscore leaderboard is basically a bar chart with screen name labels on the left and barscores displayed on the right. To tie this to the ‘At The Bar’ Visualization
					 we used bubbles for each player to display their photo. We would show the top players on the top, new leaders would animate onto the screen from above pushing others off 
					 the screen, position changes would animate respectively.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The beacons leaderboard would simply show the top leaders and highlight the iBeacons (shown as TRON symbols) as users collected them.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					And all of that had to of course happen in real-time.
				</p>
