				<h3>What is it?</h3>
				
				<p >
					<strong>iBeacon</strong> is an extension to <strong>Apple’s Location</strong> Services that provides a measurement
					of the proximity of the IOS device to a device that is broadcasting its presence with 
					Bluetooth LE.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					So before we continue with iBeacons, we need to take a step back and discuss
					Bluetooth LE.
				</p>
				
				<h3>Bluetooth LE</h3>
				
				<p>
					Bluetooth LE is a an extension to the overall Bluetooth protocol which is intended
					to enable devices to be able to transmit small payloads with Low Energy (LE) 
					requirements. By low energy, we mean devices that can potentially operate off a
					coin battery for up to 4 years.
				</p>
				
				<img src="/img/batteries.jpg">
				
				<p>
					Bluetooth LE is able to achieve this energy efficiency by keeping payloads small, 
					using “connectionless” broadcasting of advertising packets (similar to normal 
					Bluetooth discovery mode), and enabling lightweight (3ms) handshakes when 
					connections are necessary.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					This protocol allows devices to broadcast small bits of information. Possibilities are
					endless, but here are some examples:
				</p>

				<p>
					This isn’t necessarily a new concept. The ANT+ protocol has provided a low energy data 
					transmission protocol that has been used for years. For example, companies like Polar and Garmin 
					have for several years used ANT+ to transmit heart rate from a coin battery operated sensor 
					that athletes where on a chest strap to a watch, bike computer, or ... smart-phone. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Bluetooth LE is likely to displace many such ANT+ implementations, due to the
					simple fact that many devices (such as mobile phones) already have Bluetooth 
					antennas and radios, while ANT+ radios and antennas are generally add-ons.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Often the data being broadcast by these low powered devices will be useful to
					aggregate by web services into servers and databases in the Internet cloud. But
					since these low energy devices can’t directly communicate to those web services, 
					IOS devices (and other Bluetooth-enabled devices that also have wired or wireless 
					internet connections) will inevitably act as gateways to between these low energy 
					devices and the larger Internet.
				</p>
				
				<h3>
					Back to iBeacons
				</h3>
				
				<p>
					As mentioned above, iBeacon is Apple’s implementation of Bluetooth LE for 
					proximity. And although it’s Apple’s implementation, it’s worth noting that there’s				
					not really anything closed or proprietary about it, and thus Android and other 				
					development platforms that have Bluetooth LE stacks can also implement fully 
					compatible receivers of iBeacon proximity broadcasts.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					In many ways, iBeacon is Apple’s answer to NFC. With greater range and flexibility,
					together with the fact that no additional hardware needs to be deployed in the 
					device (since that Bluetooth radio and antenna is already present), any folks 
					surmise that iBeacon might be an “NFC-killer” … at least in the Apple’s eco-system.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					So an iBeacon is simply a device that broadcasts in Bluetooth LE. But unlike all
					the examples of payloads mentioned above, these devices simply broadcast their
					existence and identity.
				</p>
							
				<p>
					<em>“iBeacon E2C56DB5-DFFB-48D2-B060-D0F5A71096E0 here!”</em><br>
					<em>“iBeacon E2C56DB5-DFFB-48D2-B060-D0F5A71096E0 here!”</em><br>
					<em>“iBeacon E2C56DB5-DFFB-48D2-B060-D0F5A71096E0 here!”</em><br>
				</p>					

				<p>
					An iBeacon will repeatedly broadcast the same advertising packet over and over.
					More specifically, it will broadcast 31 bytes that break down like this:
				</p>

				<p>
					We used 2 different UUIDs to establish two different kinds of iBeacons (so that we
					could range and monitor them differently) and then used the Major/Minor number 
					to distinguish between individual iBeacons. But more on that later.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The TX Measured power is a value that indicates the strength of the signal at a 1 
					meter distance from the iBeacon. The receiving device (IOS device) then compares
					this to the measured signal strength, and is then able to estimate the distance
					between the iBeacon and the IOS device. A signal value that is weaker than the TX
					value would suggest that distance is greater than 1 meter, and an approximation 
					can be calculated. Apple abstracts this calculation in their iBeacon Stack, exposing 
					a simple scale with “Immediate”, “Near”, “Far”, or providing a estimated distance 
					value in meters.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					It is important that the iBeacon device is calibrated to determine the appropriate TX 
					value. Apple AirLocate app can assist with calibration by allowing you to physically 
					stand 1 meter from the iBeacon and measure the signal strength. In our experience, 
					there could be several factors affecting calibration (but we haven’t been able to
					verify this):
				</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Brand/model of Bluetooth radio/antenna</li>
					<li>Nature of surroundings (inside vs. outside, type of materials in the area)</li>
					<li>Density of surroundings (it seemed like open space was different than a room full of people)</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h3>
					IOS Device Support
				</h3>
				
				<p>
					Here are the requirements for iBeacon support on IOS devices:
				</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>iOS 7 or later</li>
					<li>iPhone 4s or later</li>
					<li>iPad (3rd generation) or later</li>
					<li>iPad mini (1st generation) or later</li>
					<li>iPod touch (5th generation) or later</li>
					
				</ul>
				
				<h3>
					A Few Words about iBeacon UUIDs
				</h3>
				
				<p>
					As noted above, iBeacons are identified by UUIDs. We used some generic UUIDs that 
					are often used in sample code and other developer tools (such as Apple’s utility app 
					Air Locate). We used a total of 8 iBeacons and set them up as two different UUIDs
					(so that we could range and monitor them differently on the IOS device):
				</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Claim Beacons: <code>E2C56DB5-DFFB-48D2-B060-D0F5A71096E0</code> with Major/Minor 1-6 to further distinguish</li>
					<li>Bar Beacon(s): <code>5A4BCFCE-174E-4BAC-A814-092E77F6B7E5</code> with Major/Minor number not used</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>
					Here is a list of the 8 “developer” UUIDs:
				</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li><code>E2C56DB5-DFFB-48D2-B060-D0F5A71096E0</code></li>
					<li><code>5A4BCFCE-174E-4BAC-A814-092E77F6B7E5</code></li>			
					<li><code>74278BDA-B644-4520-8F0C-720EAF059935</code></li>
					<li><code>112ebb9d-b8c9-4abd-9eb3-43578bf86a41</code></li>
					<li><code>22a17b43-552a-4482-865f-597d4c10bacc</code></li>
					<li><code>33d8e127-4e58-485b-bee7-266526d8ecb2</code></li>
					<li><code>44f506a4-b778-4c4e-8522-157aac0efabd</code></li>
					<li><code>552452fe-f374-47c4-bfad-9ea4165e1bd9</code></li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>
					It was helpful to use “developer” UUIDs because we could use other tools (like
					Apple’s AirLocate) to assist with testing, calibrating, etc. In fact, this became very
					helpful when we submitted the app for Apple’s review, because they were able
					to test our app without us having to send them iBeacon hardware. For normal 
					commercial use, however, it is expected that devlopers would use their own UUIDs 
					... and we also hope that Apple relaxes the app review process, because sending 
					them iBeacon hardware to test with seems quite onerous.
				</p>
				
				<h3>
					More on UUIDs: A Registry?
				</h3>
				
				<p>
					While we were developing, we thought it would be helpful to have a iBeacon
					registry - similar to DNS - that would enable the following:
				</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>iBeacon deployment can be made “public”, by essentially advertising where they are (and what type of information they broadcast)</li>
					<li>Enable developers to streamline UUID management (rather than hardcode, which is what we would up doing)</li>
					<li>Enable developers to write applications that leverage what will undoubtedly by a growing population of deployed iBeacons</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>
					Since iBeacons can be used for very different things, such a solutions are likely to 
					evolve in a vertical manner. An obvious vertical that many pundits are anticipating
					is Retail Merchandising.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					But here at Objectlab, we’re really hoping for a registry of all the venues with Bar Beacons!
				</p>
				
				<h3>
					Raspberry Pi as iBeacon
				</h3>
				
				<p>
					So when we began our Holiday Party Game project, we originally looked at buying
					prefabricated iBeacons from a company such as Estimote, which sells them for as 
					little as $10 each. But the lead time for delivery was too long for our purposes.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Meanwhile, a few of us had the Raspberry Pi ($40), and we soon learned that it was
					relatively easy to add a Bluetooth dongle ($10) and configure it to be an iBeacon. We
					even ordered up a Raspberry Pi from Radius Networks that came pre-configured to
					be an iBeacon.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					For those of you who may not be familiar with it, the Raspberry Pi is a low cost
					computer originally designed for educational purposes. But it’s also very useful for 
					prototyping or simulating devices that will increasingly become the “Internet of 
					Things”. And so we set about the other 7 Raspberry Pi computers as iBeacons.					
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Fortunately, configuring a Raspberry PI to be an iBeacon is both simply and fairly
					well-documented in a few blogs online. Rather than regurgitate that here, I will 
					merely summarize and offer some links to more detailed references.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The steps included:
				</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Flash a SD Card with Rasbian</li>
					<li>Install BlueZ drivers (to support Bluetooth)</li>
					<li>Start BlueZ Bluetooth</li>
					<li>Establish a config file with the UUID, Major/Minor numbers (and a default TX value)</li>
					<li>Instruct the BlueZ drivers to begin advertising the iBeacon packet</li>
					<li>Use Air Locate (on IOS device) to measure signal strength at 1 meter</li>
					<li>Modify the config file with the new Tx value)</li>
					<li>Add the iBeacon advertising startup command to the boot script</li>								
				</ul>
				
				<p>
					Now we had Raspberry Pi devices that can be plugged into a wall or any battery
					pack capable of 5V (USB) power, and within 30 seconds it will be a live iBeacon.
				</p>
