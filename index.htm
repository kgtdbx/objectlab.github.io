					<h1>Overview</h1>

				<h3>Background</h3>
				
				<p >For the past 13 years, we have thrown (what has become a rather large) Holiday party for our friends and clients in New
					York. Each year it seems to get a little more complex, simultaneously attempting to top the prior year’s venue and
					entertainment options that we provide for our guests. It’s not as fun as it sounds. So, in accordance with the time-
					honored tradition of exponentially increasing our stress level around the Holidays, we decided to throw a technology 
					component into that mix.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					In September of last year (2013), we began to toss around ideas for how we might accomplish something like this. We
					had some general parameters:
				</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>
						slightly irreverent
					</li>
					<li>
						engaging
					</li>
					<li>
						unobtrusive
					</li>
					<li>
						fun! (but not completely stupid)
					</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h3>The Initial Plan</h3>
				
				<p>
					Ernst and Chris had been working a bit with D3.js recently for our largest client, so we thought it might be interesting to
					build a visualization of users’ movements in and around the party location (in this case, a bar). Since we assumed that				
					most or all of the party-goers would have recent smartphones, we thought that maybe we could use bluetooth to sense				
					where they were and visualize their movements on screen. Googling around, we determined that it might be possible to				
					embed Raspberry Pi devices around the bar and passively detect users as they moved past them. We thought this 				
					might be a good idea since it didn’t require anything to be running on the user’s handset (other than bluetooth), and 				
					would work with both Android and IOS. As Chris found out, in order to do this correctly, you really have to pair with the 				
					target device (i.e. user’s phone) which would require some user involvement. It would also require an internet connection 				
					for each device so it could communicate with a server, and then there would be a lot of radio noise, possibly false 				
					positive detections, yada, yada. We decided to scrap this technique because it seemed too error-prone, had a lot of 				
					technical risk, and violated a few of our requirements.
				</p>
				
				<h3>The Revised Plan</h3>
				
				<p>
					Chris began to read a bit about Apple’s new iBeacon technology and presented an idea for how we might be able to
					utilize it for this application. Chris originally found out about it by reading about Estimote’s product line and thought that it
					would make it a lot simpler to handle the proximity use-cases, AND we didn’t have to fool around with Raspberry Pi’s. 
					There were a few issues with this: (1) it would only run on IOS; and (2) the delivery time for the Estimotes was about 4 
					weeks. The clock was ticking so we decided that (1) was ok, but (2) wasn’t an option.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					We began Googling ‘Raspberry Pi, iBeacon, etc’ and found that you could conﬁgure the Raspberry Pi as an iBeacon
					device. We collectively decided that this would be faster, and possibly more interesting to some of the geeks that would
					be at the party.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					After a lot of internal discussion (read: ‘spirited debate’), the plan we all agreed to (tacitly or otherwise) was the following:
				</p>
				
				<p>
					We would be build an iPhone app that utilized the iBeacon services of the IOS CoreLocation stack. The app would
					ostensibly be a ‘game’ which would have two (2) main use-cases: (1) a ‘treasure hunt’ where users would use the app to 
					ﬁnd hidden ibeacons at the party; and (2) track their proximity to the bar and increment their ‘bar score’ over time. The 
					user who had the highest bar score or the fastest time to retrieve all of the beacons would win prizes.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					A server process would track each user’s interactions with the ‘claim’ (or treasure-hunt beacons), and their proximity to
					the bar via network integration with the app. To enhance the experience, we would build visual displays that would 
					render (in real-time) each player’s beacon claiming progress and their ‘bar score’ updates (which, unsurprisingly, directly 
					correlated to how drunk they became.)
				</p>
				
				<p>
					At this point, we had about 7 weeks to get it all done.
